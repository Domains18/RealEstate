                    <h4>What is the first step in buying a home?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Buying a home can be challenging for a first-timer. After all, there are so many steps, tasks, and requirements, and you may be anxious about making an expensive mistake. But first-time homebuyers enjoy some special advantages created to encourage new entrants into the real estate market.
                        To demystify the process, so you get the most out of your purchase, here is a rundown of what you need to consider before you buy and what you can expect from the buying process itself, plus tips to make life easier after you buy your first home.

                    <h4>What is the first step in buying a home?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Home inspections can uncover potentially life-threatening problems like mold or faulty wiring that could cause a significant fire. Most potential buyers have a seven-day window after a home inspection to walk away from the purchase. A thorough inspection is a critical step in purchasing a home.

                    <h4>Should I sell my current property before buying a new one? </h4>
                    <p>
                        Selling first is beneficial if you need to access your current home equity to buy your new home. However, selling first often requires temporary housing while buying your new house. From a real estate market standpoint, selling before buying makes the most sense for people who are selling in a buyers market.
